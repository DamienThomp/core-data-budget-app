# Budget App Project

Very basic demo Budget App project built with SwiftUI, using CoreData for persistent state. Includes loacalization for FR-CA (Google Translated). 
Experimented with iOS 18 mesh gradients for backgrounds, with subtle animation. 

## Future Improvements

 - [ ] Add quantity for expenses
 - [ ] Add light and dark mode themes (currently only supports dark mode)
 - [ ] Improve layout and code quality (refactor passes)
